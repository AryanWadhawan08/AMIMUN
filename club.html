                                  It is a matter of great pride that Amity University Uttar Pradesh (AUUP) is organising the 10th edition of
Amity International Model United Nations (AMIMUN’21), first time on the virtual platform, on the
theme “Winds of Change: Navigating Through A New Normal in The Multipolar World” from
Saturday, the 20th March, to Sunday, the 21st of March 2021. The event becomes all the more important
in the backdrop of COVID-19 pandemic and has given us a unique opportunity to witness indomitable
human spirit not only to withstand but also thrive in the face of any unprecedented challenge.
With our belief in harnessing excellence in the field of innovative and adaptive education, whilst keeping
the holistic approach intact, Amity strives to make AMIMUN’21 an experience that will uphold the
mission of encouraging students to pursue futuristic frontiers ideas to change the world for better.
Amity aims to consolidate AMIMUN’s worldwide recognition and its status as one of the top MUNs
across the continent with the participation of delegates from across the world. <span id="dots1">...</span
                ><span id="more1">
I am confident that this event will provide a platform to young people to come forward, redefine
their “new normal” and provide their ideas, solutions, and suggestions to build a better future and
will connect brilliant minds to deliberate on real issues and suggest solutions for that.
The teaching philosophy of Amity particularly focuses on values and Sanskars and importantly, the
understanding of close cross-cultural nuances. At Amity, the students are nurtured with such attributes
in an environment that motivates analytical thinking on matters that concerns the humankind. AMIMUN
caters the mission of Amity and further complements it by providing a representational prevue of United
Nations functions and its deliberation on crucial global issues.
AMIMUN'21 will provide an opportunity to the students to become familiar with global concerns and
the working of the United Nations where the delegates will attempt to resolve regional and international
problems in a powerful, yet engaging manner through debates, diplomacy and negotiations. It will
prove to be a platform to commence an optimistic outcome for the world andthe youth. As the
leaders and changemakers of tomorrow unite at this conference, they will hone their skills of
leadership, teamwork, expository and persuasive writing, debating and negotiations, and learn the
significance of such traits to become successful professionals in future.
All participants, from India as well as from diverse regions of the globe such as USA, Canada, Romania,
UAE among others, will find AMIMUN'21 to be a convention where their unique talents and capabilities
will enable them to achieve professional growth.
I convey my appreciation to Dr. Alpana Kakkar, Dy. Dean (Students Welfare), Dr. Nitasha Hasteer, Dy. Director (Academics)
and all the hardworking team members of AMIMUN’21 including Mr. Meshuwa Mawthoh, Secretary General,
Mr. Rohan Nagpal, Director General, Ms. Simran Malhotra, Charge D’ Affairs, Ms. Hiba Mukhtar Dedmari,
Chef de Cabinet as well as members of Organizing Committee and other brilliant students. I also compliment
Dr. Balvinder Shukla, Vice Chancellor, AUUP, for her valuable support and guidance. The most strategic and
visionary leadership of Dr. Atul Chauhan, Chancellor, AUUP and President, Ritnand Balved Education Foundation
(RBEF), would lead to outcome based and result oriented success of AMIMUN '21.
I welcome all the participants and wish them a pleasant experience with debating which will go a long
way in their personal and professional growth. I am confident that they will cherish this enriching and
engaging environment of the Amity Universe on virtual platform as they participate in AMIMUN’21.
I wish AMIMUN’21 a great success.</span

                ><span id="more2">
This year’s edition of AMIMUN’21 Conference will be the first e-AMIMUN edition and will host over 300 delegates from across the globe. The theme perfectly incapsulates the challenging times during the pandemic and the relentless determination of each individual to succeed. Due to the recent global pandemic the World has witnessed a breakthrough and organizations across the globe has reformed their existing global policies and procedures. AMIMUN'21 will be a platform for the delegates to learn, understand the diplomatic relations between Nations, inculcate leadership skills and acquire intellectual competence to be socially responsible. It is my firm belief that by encouraging students to organize and participate in such events, we push the boundaries of creativity and innovation, and help them in thinking out of the box. It not only prepares the future leaders but initiates and sparks the feeling of empathy and social responsibility amongst the future generation.
 I welcome the distinguished guests at AMIMUN’21 on the virtual platform and am certain that they will serve as role models for the students participating in the Conference. The vast experience and inspiration expressed in their words will help the delegates realize the significance of skills such as strategic thinking and critical analysis as well as the importance of positivity, humility, and compassion in their journey to make a real difference in the world.
 
AMIMUN’21 promises to be a conference of high repute owing to the sincere efforts of the devoted organizing members and the team of committed students. I extend my best wishes for AMIMUN’21 to be a reverberating success and hope that it builds upon the foundation laid by its outstanding previous editions.</span>

                  A Model United Nations is a scholarly simulation of the
                  different procedures of the United Nations, with understudies
                  addressing different nations. Not only has the fame of MUNs
                  taken off, it has also settled as a unique stage where the
                  promising delegates come together and learn myriad skills.
                  AMIMUN has helped members from across the world to observe the
                  extraordinary relevance of learning foreign relations and
                  understanding the working and meaning of the United Nations.
                  Constructing harmonious relations, security, social
                  advancement, better expectations of the world and common
                  liberties, are various viewpoints that are underscored by the
                  young minds at AMIMUN. The theme for AMIMUN'21 “Winds of
                  Change: Navigating through A New Normal in the Multipolar
                  World”, has been meticulously chosen to make sure that the
                  young assume the responsibility to rise from the myriad of
                  issues and find a solution. AMIMUN’21 aim to present a
                  worldwide viewpoint through a space that will mix countries to
                  meet and make a reality where we discover development and
                  tranquility in concurrence. This virtual MUN will be a
                  one-of-a-kind experience, with varied participants from
                  universities from all around the world, especially when the
                  physical borders are replaced by connections of internet and
                  accessibility. I take this opportunity to convey my best
                  wishes to the delegates and wish them a great learning
                  experience. I am certain that the hard work and commitment of
                  the organizing committee members and the Secretariat will make
                  AMIMUN’21 a splendid success! Best Wishes,</span

Seeing the striking development of AMIMUN and the progress the student body has gone through from the primary release of physical AMIMUN to the online AMIMUN, is both amazing and motivating. AMIMUN'21 makes it certain to be a mixture of riveting discussion, singular development, and progressive thoughts, encouraging agents to draw nearer to turning into the policymakers of tomorrow.

By following the theme for AMIMUN'21 "Winds of Change: Navigating through A New Normal in the Multipolar World", we wish to urge the representatives to participate in a discussion that presents novel thoughts which will yield forward answers for the major problems of today. In the current situation, actions speak louder than words. Thus, it is when there is consolidated action the humanity itself progresses.

I want to extend my appreciation to our visionary Founder President Sir Dr. Ashok K Chauhan, and Chancellor AUUP, Dr. Atul Chauhan, Patron-in-Chief AMIMUN'21 for their constant encouragement, Vice Chancellor AUUP, Prof. (Dr.) Balvinder Shukla , Patron AMIMUN’21 for her continuous guidance and support in making this conference possible. 

It is my conviction that AMIMUN'21 will be a resounding achievement and that the dedication of the Secretariat, Organizing Committee members have put in their efforts that AMIMUN'21 will be a memorable conference.</span>
