                        The first e-Edition of Amity International Model United Nations is a simulation of the United Nations spanning over two days. At AMIMUN, delegates gain profound knowledge of diplomacy, global relations, and the inner workings of the United Nations. Through the past nine editions, AMIMUN has set a standard of MUNs throughout the Nation with its innovative themes. To continue the same legacy, the first e-Edition of AMIMUN aims to create a platform where deliberation on issues that address global problems and drafting resolutions will enhance critical thinking, public speaking, and leadership skills. Delegates will become conscious of the causes of conflict between nations. Thus, AMIMUN follows through with the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations: "To practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours‚Äù.
