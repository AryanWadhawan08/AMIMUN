              Model United Nations conferences are not only verbal debates but a
              clash of core ideas and their application to the real world. This
              aspect of MUNs to focus on actionable change is something I
              believe is especially important as it lays a clear focus on
              problem-solving instead of abstract, principled debate. This focus
              on problem-solving is what sets MUNs apart from other activities
              since they actively incentivize the creation of a wide knowledge
              base built on strong research and develop clarity of action.
              problems. The Amity International Model United Nations Conference
              has become a stalwart in the circuit as an incredible stage for
              the young to see how the world functions and manages its issues
              while guaranteeing phenomenal debate and extraordinary levels of
              quality and hospitality. During my tenure as the Secretary General
              of the 9th edition of this conference, I learned essential values
              like responsibility, discipline, and most importantly leadership
              and teamwork through empathy and humility. The mammoth task of
              organizing a flawless conference is incomplete without the backing
              of an ever passionate and driven team, a team that soon became
              family. This year as a part of the Advisory board for AMIMUN’21, I
              am certain that this edition will continue to build on this
              tremendous legacy and become a fine illustration of excellent
              debate and discourse. I am sure that my juniors have corroborated
              an incredible experience for all the participants. It is indeed my
              honor and privilege to welcome you all to the e-Edition of Amity
              International Model United Nations Conference, 2021.

              Amity International Model United Nations has always believed that
              activities like MUNs bring about tangible change, and help shape
              the leaders of the future. The team behind this conference
              believes that the power of student discourse can bring out the
              solutions to the problems which plague the world today.<br />
              I truly feel honored to be part of the advisory board of one of
              the biggest MUNs in the country, with students of all domains,
              spending their time working on problems that are necessary to be
              acted upon. Rich with experience and led by some of the best
              debaters in the circuit, the conference strives to bring out the
              best in each individual associated with it and promotes the values
              of the United Nations whilst working towards a better future.<br />
              This year the AMIMUN team is bringing the online edition of AMIMUN
              conference which strengthens my belief that even a pandemic
              can&#39;t stop any of us to collaborate, discuss and debate to
              bring about a change in society. It is just a matter of finding a
              way to bring about that change and that is exactly what the AMIMUN
              team has done. I extend my warm wishes and support to the entire
              team for the upcoming AMIMUN 2021 conference.<br />

              AMIMUN is one of the most prestigious conferences in the MUN
              circuit. I am extremely grateful to be a part of its legacy.<br />
              I have seen it all in AMIMUN be it as a delegate in my first year
              of college, an OC member in the second year, leading the marketing
              team in my third year to being the Director General of the
              conference in its 2020 edition. Behind the deliberation and
              discussion that goes on inside the committees for 3 days, there is
              a huge team of students that work day and night for months to make
              it possible. AMIMUN teaches you life skills, how to handle
              different critical situations, how to manage people and align them
              to the common goal which is to have the best conference by far
              every year.<br />
              I know delegates coming in this year will have a great experience
              as well. As an Advisor to this e-Edition of AMIMUN, I will try to
              the best of my capacity to help the team learn from our previous
              mistakes and make new ones for themselves. I wish best of luck to
              my juniors who are working tirelessly to make the e-Edition of
              AMIMUN a success, I believe in them.<br />

              “Sometimes it’s the smallest decisions that can change your life
              forever.” —Keri Russell<br />
              I strongly believe that I changed my life for good when I first
              stepped into the world of Model UN. Since school I have learned so
              much through interaction, lobbying, and researching about the
              past, and hoping to build a better future. The Model United
              Nations is an incredibly powerful platform for the youth to
              understand how the world works and deal with its problems. We as
              future world leaders should have the ability to work with people
              of different ages and backgrounds.<br />
              AMIMUN has been a great platform not only as a delegate but also
              as the Organizing Member. My tenure as the Secretary General
              taught me the values of discipline, responsibility, and above all
              leadership- an ability I hope each delegate conquers through
              participating in this conference. As mentioned by my senior and a
              legacy holder Gurmehak Maan, &quot;AMIMUN is more than a
              conference. AMIMUN is an emotion.&quot; I encourage young orators
              to be a part of AMIMUN 2021 and take advantage of the wonderful
              opportunities that it will provide- especially in a year we should
              all be grateful for. Wishing the entire Organising Team and the
              Secretariat of AMIMUN&#39;21 the very best for the conference.<br />

              It takes sufficient fortitude to talk about your opinions and one
              who gets the determination to talk, changes the world. MUNs are
              only an adept clarification of the equivalent. With a way to deal
              with strategy and the assurance to support peacekeeping
              universally, these reenactments of the United Nations Diaspora
              samely affect a youthful ambassador&#39;s brain. The Amity Model
              United Nations is an unfathomably fantastic stage for the youth to
              perceive how the world capacities and deals with its issues. At
              AMIMUN we assure you of a world- class experience with delegates
              coming across the globe and becoming the best possible platform to
              test your skills as possible future leaders.<br />
              As a part of the Advisory board for AMIMUN&#39;21, I&#39;m sure
              that AMIMUN will wind up being a fine delineation of the
              Delegate&#39;s capacity to impact and achieve the transformation
